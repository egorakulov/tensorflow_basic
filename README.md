# Learning Tensorflow

## Purpose of this repository

The purpose of this repo is to track my progress learning how to use tensorflow. 
I will be following the lessons on tensorflow.org to learn about ML. 
Eventually, I will implement what I learned and build my own ML project. 
This other project will have its own repo.
